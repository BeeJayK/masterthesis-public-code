This folder contains data that shall be evaluated with a solution for the
motion classification. One main folder contains three subfolders:
	01_Processed_Videos: the frame representation (-> tiff pictures)
			    of the video. Create with the Create_Train_Data
			    Routine
	02_Label_Tables: optional. If provided, the models output is not
			displayed but can also be evaluated
	03_Model: contains the .h5 model to use, possibly with a config file

The processed video will be saved into the evaluation folder.

The data in here is ignored for the gitupload

@BeeJayK synced this folder with his own pCloud structure. If 
you use this repo for development, @BeeJayK would recommend you
to do it the same way.
