Contains one folder for every video, in which one .csv file per frame is to
be found. This file contains the raw MediaPipe output along with
some flags (see helpers repo, coordinate_position_assignment.py).
The name of each file is [framenum_label]. This way, it can easily
be used in the input pipeline of a model.

The train data files are excluded from the git repository

@BeeJayK synced this folder with his own pCloud structure. If 
you use this repo for development, @BeeJayK would recommend you
to do it the same way.
