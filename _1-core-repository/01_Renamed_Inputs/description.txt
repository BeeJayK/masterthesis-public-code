The structure here will be a mirror of "00_Raw_Video", but with the inputs renamed
to ensure they are named properly: The Name of every file within each video folder
now represents its frame number, starting at 0.
The content in here is to be used for the labeling

The videos are excluded in the git repository

@BeeJayK synced this folder with his own pCloud structure. If 
you use this repo for development, @BeeJayK would recommend you
to do it the same way.
