Here, different data-packs (-> folders) can be created, each 
representing an entire data pack to train/validate a model on.

Each data pack contains multiple folders, where on folder represents one
video. Each video folder contains one csv-file with the extracted hand-
coordinates for each frame in the video, so there might be a bunch of
files in there.

The data in here is ignored for the gitupload

@BeeJayK synced this folder with his own pCloud structure. If 
you use this repo for development, @BeeJayK would recommend you
to do it the same way.
